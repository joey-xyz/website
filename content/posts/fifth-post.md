## Mid-Season Closing Pitcher Reevaluation Strategy: Help From My Gen AI Assistant

**TL;DR** *GenAI doesn't know what you don't tell it. A researcher is required for the lens they bring: knowing the surrounding biases and assumptions, and more importantly, the context surrounding a study. And a good researcher, using GenAI, will direct their assistant with actionable prompts.*

GenAI can assist researchers. Not by doing the work for you, but it can help construct your research plan, evaluate data (by creating weighted systems to tell you when a piece of info is valuable, for instance), and even help identify key findings. But GenAI doesn't know what you don't tell it. A researcher is required for the lens they bring: knowing the surrounding biases and assumptions, and more importantly, the context surrounding a study (business drivers, historical inputs, tech debt and engineering requirements, etc.).

**The most important part of using GenAI to assist your research process is prompt writing - the things you say to it. Excellent prompt writing requires repeated attempts to ensure it understands what you're asking it to do, to ensure that you get the trusted results you need. You're still the researcher, and GenAI is only your assistant.**

## The Case Study

This post illustrates how prompt writing for GenAI can help you with your research and analysis. Sure, fantasy baseball isn't UX research, the process nevertheless takes a validation approach - in confirming my evaluation criteria and weighted strategy - and also begins an early process of discovery - by suggesting next steps and sequential courses of action for results at a later date.

With only six weeks left of the fantasy baseball season, one closing pitcher on the injured list, and another one failing to generate saves, I employed my GenAI assistant to help evaluate and make decisions: who to drop and who to pick up for my team.

Below are screengrabs illustrating the conversation we had, with a focus on redrafting prompts to achieve my desired result: a process for appraising and choosing closing pitchers and my next steps.
