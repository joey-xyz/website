I lead product research at the intersection of behaviour and technology adoption. My work shapes business strategy and revenue decisions, not just feature validation.

Specializing in trust-first AI experiences, gamification and habit loops, and content design, I use mixed-methods discovery to influence product prioritization and go-to-market strategy, from B2B SaaS to B2C digital entertainment. With academic training in human behaviour and 8 years in digital product research, I deliver high-signal insights that drive measurable impact under any constraint.
