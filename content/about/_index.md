With over 7 years in research and service design – following nearly a decade studying human behavior and business development products – I now create, lead, and implement customer-focused user experience (UX) strategies and solutions for complex digital environments.

I build scalable, efficient, ethical, and impactful research practices that align with business goals. By blending systems-level thinking with empathy, I operationalize these practices, identify and diagnose inefficiencies to plan, develop, and optimize our research to design intuitive user experiences. Fluent in mixed methods research - qualitative vs. quantitative, attitudinal vs. behavioral - I run low lift studies for high signal impact to uncover experiences and unmet human centred design needs.
