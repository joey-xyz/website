## TL;DR

**Built and managed the User Chats program (Voice of the Customer) with a dedicated research panel of 200 users; increased program participation as mentor to all client-facing roles from 40% to 80%.**

Wattpad is a storytelling platform connecting readers and writers with 94M global users. Like all apps, it’s important for the company’s staff to be connected to the users of the products they make. We call this empathy in UX (user experience) research. Weekly User Chats, the program I built, ensures an empathetic relation for client-facing staff. Regular interaction with customers enables us to build products that serve important functions in people’s lives.

## Situation: The Problem 

Sure, everyone who works for an app company knows how to use it. But we shouldn’t assume we’re all power-users (the most elite, avid customers). What’s more, we as the product builders, are biased. So **it’s important to have regular contact with the users we serve because it helps us do our jobs better, create stronger products, and solve our users problems.**

How do we regularly connect with our users? With a Voice of the Customer program I call “Weekly User Chats.”

## Task: What Answers Do We Need?

I inherited a haphazard program (no one’s fault; common with no dedicated Operations person in place). **I was urgently tasked not with a renovation but a full tear-down and reconstruct.** By briefly talking to a handful of key people, I noticed that everyone was frustrated by the do-it-yourself nature: **expired how-to docs, interviewee no-shows that cause unnecessary disruption to our staff’s workday, and stilted conversations that left us nowhere closer to our users.** 

***

## Action: How I Solved The Problems

1. Evaluation and Optimization of Tools: Review current tools & methods for these chats: Are the right tools used? Do our current methods enable scalable, efficient, ethical, and impactful conversations with our users?

> Google Meet had previously been used. On the participants side, many struggled with access or reliability; on the staff side, there were privacy issues (since individual staff email accounts were associated with the private link). Zoom for Wattpad Research was established, allowing a single, reusable link between staff. And participants felt more confident with the consistent branding presented with Zoom (ie: I had a standard background with Wattpad’s logo for every call, regardless of which staff members were present).

2. Streamline onboarding: A clear tutorial that took less than 15 minutes, once, and done (Figure 2)! 

> Included step-by-step numbered instructions, images, video, and personal assistance when troubleshooting is necessary (Figure 3 & 4).

3. Implement automation: It costs less to pay our users though our participant management tool, than for the labor time to manually do it. 

> Bonus: participants are paid sooner, making them happier, and more likely to show up again! 

4. Evaluation & Optimization of Guides: Review, amalgamate, edit, and write new processes, guides, and templates. 

> Designed a linked 4-Guide system:

> This new system facilitates the ability to access all docs simultaneously, and was embedded in every staff-side Weekly User Chat calendar link and pinned in the corresponding Slack channel, for ease.

Additionally, I included more nuanced methods in the Interview Guide (Figure 9), like Continuous Interviewing Techniques (for the more advanced) and Approaches to Answering Proprietary Questions (for the anxious) (Figure 9).

## Result: Metrics Unlocked 

1. Decreased no-show rate by 75% with personalized and automated reminders; created and managed a dedicated participant pool of 200 users (with access to thousands more for continued growth).  

2. Increased program participation as mentor to all client-facing staff from 40% to 80%.

3. Tripled insights sharing activity on #weekly-user-chats Slack channel.

4. Built trust cross-functionally in the value of qualitative research, enabling stronger partnerships between UX (Design & Research) and Product.

## Next Time: Scaling Considerations

Getting lost in the iteration sauce can be a problem. Sure, things can always be improved, but at some point, it's functionally and pleasingly good enough. Because the Weekly User Chats program felt like my bebe, I tinkered distractidly too much. **I'd set quarterly or biannual review parameters to rein in the too frequent tweaks.**
