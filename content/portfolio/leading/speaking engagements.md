## dscout Panel "Levers of Flexibility" - October 17, 2023

Invited as contributor to panel of UX Research leaders, where I shared Operations-focused learnings. TL;DR of my advice: prevention of getting lost in "triage loops." Takeaways from panel: differentiate between research insights and business recommendations; own impact with product managers; clearly communicate value of research with “We wouldn’t know [ x ] without the findings from this study.”
