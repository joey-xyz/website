[YouTube link to virtual replay](https://youtu.be/YhvE8whw9QU?t=923&si=osfCaQJUTHW18ef0)

Invited as contributor to panel of UX Research leaders, where I shared Operations-focused learnings about how to remain flexible in research. 

**TL;DR - My advice centred on preventing getting stuck in "triage loops." 3 Takeaways from panel: 1) differentiate between research insights and business recommendations; 2) own impact with product managers; 3) clearly communicate value of research with “We wouldn’t know [ x ] without the findings from this study.”**

The panel for this Community Call responded to this question: *"Where does research live in your organization and what are the benefits and pain points of that?*" 

**TL;DR - My process begins with determining the acceptable risks upfront (front-loading and managing expectations!) to allow for triage of the most urgent issues.**
