As a former educator, I enjoy helping those I work with gain clarity and insight. I work from where *you* are, not from what *I* know. Whether mentoring junior researchers or training cross-functional partners on democratized research practices, I aim to deliver knowledge that will keep you growing as a practitioner of your craft.

# Coaching Sessions: Case Study of *3 Questions for PMs Working with UXRs*    

![alt](/images/portfolio/leading/3questions_pm.png)

## TL;DR 

**100% Product Managerâ€™s participation in monthly de-risk coaching sessions.**

## Role 

Cross-Functional Team Lead

## Duration

Monthly over 1.5 years 

## Methods

Subject-Matter-Expert Interviews, Surveys, Design Review, Human-Centred Design, Feedback Review  

## Tools

Airtable, Slack, Figma, Confluence, Google Docs, Polly.ai, Google Meet

## Reach 

14 Product Managers (3 Director; 4 Senior PM; 6 PM; 1 Associate PM)

***

## Situation: The Problem  

I hold monthly coaching sessions with Product Managers (PMs) at Wattpad to **ensure Research and Product share the same drivers and blockers**. In a previous session,  I toured the PMs through Experience Research offerings - methods and tools - so the PMs better understood when, why, and how we use each. For this particular session, I surveyed the PMs to discover their needs, and then modelled future sessions.

## Task: What Answers Do We Need?

For this session, I wanted to know three things (and suggested they select all that apply, visible by the percentages): 

1. What's working for you with your UXR partnerships?

> Getting insights I need (78%)

> I'm able to make more informed product decisions (78%)

> I understand our users better (56%)

> UXR is essential for identifying potential future product opportunities (56%)

> Time to insights has improved (33%)

2. What could be improved in your partnerships with UXR (qualitative, open-ended question = text results below)?

> Working more closely with data scientists 

> Limitations to research discovery

> Knowing what questions to ask

> Product use cases 

> Product discovery, improvements, and problem identification 

3. What would I, as a PM, like to know more about (select all that apply, visible by the percentages)?

> Appraising risk (78%)

> User workflows (56%)

> Research limitations (44%)

> Insights interpretation (44%) 

> Asking research discovery questions (33%)

## Action: How I Solved The Problem

Prioritizing the results above, I designed and offered the following resources to not only improve the PMs and our product offerings, but also to bolster cross-functionality.

* Weekly User Chat Guide & Resources (Voice of the Customer program, discussed ***here*** in my portfolio)

* Video tour (using Loom) of how to access and use our Insights Repository Airtable.

* UXR Office Hours - biweekly sessions to hone PMs democratized research craft. 

* Developed a Research Risk Matrix tool to illustrate low-and-high lift research (not incl. in above screengrab, but ***here***).

***

## Result: Metrics Unlocked 

The survey results aided in strengthening the Research team's cross-functional relationship with our PM partners, because we could tailor how we work with them for each product vertical.

*After this single session:*

1. PMs 50% more confident in drafting questions to ask Analytics or to develop user survey questions.

*With coaching support overall:*

2. Shipped more, sooner. 

> With better awareness of what features or iterations require rigorous testing vs. minimum viable research to bypass additional inquiry, with the Research Risk Matrix.

3. Tighter and better aligned research & product roadmaps.

> Decreased timeframes for desk, competitor, and market research.

## Next Time: Scaling Considerations 

**Concision over verbosity**. In the past year I've edited my communication processes, aiming for easier explanations in as few words as possible. I know this will increase participation and usability of my stakeholder surveys, research decks, and presentations.
