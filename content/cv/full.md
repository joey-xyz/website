## TL;DR

I've founded research and operations practices and mentored teams, and develop tools and frameworks that achieve results, like a 75% adoption rate for Wattpad’s Coin Wallet feature in a single quarter. I co-managed a startup team to secure a $100K grant in six months, and co-authored a white paper that influenced $805M in federal socio-environmental business innovation funding.

- 2014 Student Paper Prize winner, **Canadian Communication Association**

    *"War Photography After Abu Ghraib: A Preliminary Analysis"*

    Colette Brin, CCA President, shared this citation of Joey's winning essay: 

> "The jury found Jakob's concept of War Trophy Photography very compelling. Jakob is thorough and convincing in her explanation of **visual semiotics**. The author is also fluid in her sharing of the literature, the two **examples work well to show how photos limit our readings/experiences of the content** and her engagement with the topic make the paper a pleasure to read.  And while her paper looks back to WWII and brings War Trophy Photography to the present via Abu Ghraib, War Trophy Photography in the era of **new information and communication technology** offers endless opportunities for future research."
